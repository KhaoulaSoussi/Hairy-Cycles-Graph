# Hairy-Cycle-Graph

## Description
This programming challenge was part of the Honors component of Analysis of Algorithms class with Dr. Naeem Nisar Sheikh.
The purpose is to check whether a graph is a hairy cycle. A hairy cycle is just a cycle, where each vertex may (but doesn't have to) have one or more paths of any length coming of it.
Here's an example of a hairy cycle:
